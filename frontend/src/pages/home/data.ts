  "In Sanskrit, ganja is the term for female cannabis flowers that are unfertilized. Indian swamis have had a deep relationship with ganja. Cannabis was used as a remedy for phlegm overproduction and diarrhea from the third to eighth centuries BCE and later used in Indian folk medicine as an aphrodisiac and pain killer. The term really gained popularity when it was adopted by Jamaicans â€” and, in particular, Jamaicans who followed the Rastafari movement, a religion that began on the island in the 1930s.";
